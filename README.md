# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The data includes around 7000 instances and 21 features (Gender; Dependents; Tenure; Internet Service: Yes, No; Monthly Charges; Contract, etc) and the label is Customer Churn (Yes, No). 
I used some supervised machine learning models and the best score I got so far is 79% with Random Forest and Logistic Regression. 
Through the feature importance process, I learned that Monthly Charge, Tenure time, and Contract term are the 3 features that affect the most on whether or not customers leave. The tree graph shows that customers are likely to churn if the tenure time is less than 12 months.
